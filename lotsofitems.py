"""
SQLAlchemy executes CRUD operations via an interface called a session
Sessions allow us to write down all commands we want to execute but not
send to the database until calling a commit

Use these to begin interpeter queries:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from database_setup import Base, Genre, Movie
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///catalog.db')
Base.metadata.bind = engine
DBSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = DBSession()

This gives us a staging zone for all the objects loaded into the DBSession
object

Any change made to the objects in the session won't be persisted into the
database until we call session.commit()

Some Categories:
Action
Adventure
Comedy
Drama
Fantasy
Horry
Mystery
Romance
Science Fiction
Thriller

CREATE
Syntax for making a New Entry (Genre)
>>> new_entry = ClassName(property='value', ...)
>>> session.add(new_entry)
>>> session.commit()

Add an Movie
>>> alien = Movie(name='Alien', description='A 1979 film directed by Ridley
... Scott, it follows the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo who
... encounter the eponymous Alien, a deadly and aggressive extraterrestrial
... set loose on the ship.', genre=first_genre)
>>> session.add(alien)
>>> session.commit()

READ
Use the Session to Interact with the Database
We can check that a new entry was added by using

>>> session.query(Category).all()
[<database_setup.Category object at 0x10d4aeef0>]

This goes into the database and finds the table that corresponds to the
Category class and finds all the entries in the table and returns them in a
list

Check that the Movie was added
>>> session.query(Movie).all()
[<database_setup.Movie object at 0x10e47c400>]

UPDATE
If we want to edit anything we can query the database for a specific item

The .one() at the end makes sure SQLAlchemy only gives the one object we want
instead of a list we have to iterate over

>>> alien = session.query(Movie).filter_by(id=1).one()

Just to check
>>> alien.name
'Alien'
>>> alien.id
1
>>> alien.description
'A 1979 film directed by Ridley Scott, it follows the crew of the commercial
 space tug Nostromo who encounter the eponymous Alien, a deadly and aggressive
 extraterrestrial set loose on the ship'
>>> alien.description = 'A 1979 film directed by Ridley Scott, it follows the
... crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo who encounter the eponymous
... alien, a deadly and aggressive extraterrestrial set loose on the ship'
>>> session.add(alien)
>>> session.commit()

To check the change was made

>>> alien = session.query(Movie).filter_by(id=1).one()
>>> alien.description
'A 1979 film directed by Ridley Scott, it follows the crew of the commercial
 space tug Nostromo who encounter the eponymous alien, a deadly and aggressive
 extraterrestrial set loose on the ship'

DELETE
In order to delete from our database, we want to query for the object we want
to delete, delete it, then commit the session

>>> schindler = session.query(Movie).filter_by(name="Schindler's List").one()
>>> session.delete(schindler)
>>> session.commit()

Now we can search again to see if the movie was deleted

>>> schindler = session.query(Movie).filter_by(name="Schindler's List").one()
