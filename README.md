# Item Catalog

An application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items. A requirement for Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree Program.

## Getting Started

My operating system is a Mac so the installation instructions reflect this system. The code editor used was Atom. Most of the files and configurations were provided by Udacity.

### Installing Git

Git is already installed on MacOS, but these instructions are to ensure we have the latest version:

1. go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. download the software for Mac
3. install Git choosing all the default options

Once everything is installed, you should be able to run `git` on the command line. If usage information is displayed, we're good to go!

### Configuring Mac's Terminal (OPTIONAL)

Git can be used without reconfiguring the terminal but doing so makes it easier to use.

To configure the terminal, perform the following:

1. download [udacity-terminal-config.zip](http://video.udacity-data.com.s3.amazonaws.com/topher/2017/March/58d31ce3_ud123-udacity-terminal-config/ud123-udacity-terminal-config.zip)
2. Move the `udacity-terminal-config` directory to the directory of your choice and name it `.udacity-terminal-config`(Note the dot in front)
3. Move the `bash-profile` to the same directory as in `step 2` and name it `.bash_profile`(Note the dot in front)
    * If you already have a `.bash_profile` file in your directory, transfer the content from the downloaded `bash_profile` to the existing `.bash_profile`

**Note:** It's considerably easier to just use
`mv bash_profile .bash_profile`
and `mv udacity-terminal-config .udacity-terminal-config`
when moving and renaming these files in order to avoid mac system errors

### First Time Git Configuration
Run each of the following lines on the command line to make sure everything is set up.
```
# sets up Git with your name
git config --global user.name "<Your-Full-Name>"

# sets up Git with your email
git config --global user.email "<your-email-address>"

# makes sure that Git output is colored
git config --global color.ui auto

# displays the original state in a conflict
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

git config --list
```

### Git & Code Editor

The last step of configuration is to get Git working with your code editor. Below is the configuration for Atom. If you use a different editor, then do a quick search on Google for "associate X text editor with Git" (replace the X with the name of your code editor).
```
git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```

### Install Virtual Box

VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the virtual machine. Download it [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1). Install the platform package for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it; Vagrant will do that.

### Install Vagrant

Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem. Download it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). Install the version for your operating system.

If vagrant is successfully installed, you will be able to run `vagrant --version` in the terminal to see the version number.

### Download VM configuration

Download [FSND-Virtual-Machine.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5acfbfa3_fsnd-virtual-machine/fsnd-virtual-machine.zip). This will give you a directory called **FSND-Virtual-Machine**.

Alternatively you can fork the repo [https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm) on Github.

Change to this newly downloaded directory using `cd` in the terminal. Change to the `vagrant`
directory inside.

### Starting the Virtual Machine

From your terminal, inside the vagrant subdirectory, run the command `vagrant up`. Vagrant will download the Linux operating system and install it. This may take quite a while (many minutes) depending on how fast your Internet connection is.

When `vagrant up` is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run `vagrant ssh` to log in to your newly installed Linux VM!

### Logged In

If you are now looking at a shell prompt that starts with the word `vagrant` congratulations â€” you've gotten logged into your Linux VM.

## Version

This project uses `Python 3`

## Run catalog.py

With data loaded and with `catalog.py` in the `vagrant/catalog` directory, run:

```
python catalog.py
```

or, if this doesn't work:

```
python3 catalog.py
```

### Visit localhost:8000

With the application running, visit `http://localhost:8000` on your favorite browser to test out the app.

## Exit the App

To exit the app, on your keyboard press `control + c`.

## Exit Vagrant

To exit vagrant, on your keyboard press `control + d`.

## Issues
### Facebook Login
When logging in with Facebook, a popup window is generated. Depending on your browser settings, this window may be blocked. You will have to enable this window in order to log in.
After logging in, Facebook will tell you to `close tab to continue to app` please do so.
You will then have to login again by clicking the Facebook login button once more. This will then say `previously logged in, do you wish to continue to app?` in which you say Ok
